#  In this Kata, you will be given an array of numbers in which two numbers occur once and the rest occur only twice. 
#  Your task will be to return the sum of the numbers that occur only once.
#  For example, repeats([4,5,7,5,4,8]) = 15 because only the numbers 7 and 8 occur once, and their sum is 15.
#  More examples in the test cases below.
#  Good luck!
